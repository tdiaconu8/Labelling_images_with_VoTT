# Labelling images with VoTT

This repository presents a way to label images for computer vision using VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool).

Here we present how to convert JSON files generated by VoTT in text files that will bu useful to train our neural network models.

When tagging images on VoTT, JSON files are exported. There is one JSON file by labelled image. Each JSON has the same structure and it contains many important information like: image size, list of regions (rectangles per labelled object), etc.

This code provides a way to convert such a JSON file in a text file that will have the same title as the image and that will list on each line the different rectangles of the objects labelled in the image.
